# DECISIONS.md — Orion OS Universal

> Decisions that apply to **every project** built with Orion OS.
> Project-specific decisions live in your instance repo as `projects/<project>-decisions.md`.

---

## 1. TEAM AND ROLES

**D1. The founder is the sole business decision maker.**

**D2. Orion acts as technical architect and coordinator.**

**D3. Agents have specialized roles — they execute, not decide.**

**D4. The founder always tests before an issue is closed.**

---

## 2. WORKFLOW

**D5. All issues for a project live in a single repo (typically the backend repo).**

**D6. Each issue includes: context + agent prompt + test plan.**

**D7. Maximum 2 issues In Progress simultaneously per project.**

**D8. When Orion says "we'll do that later", an issue is created immediately.**

**D9. When the founder proposes an idea, Orion analyzes it technically before creating the issue.**

**D52. Commits use `ref #XX` — never `closes #XX` or `fixes #XX`.**

**D53. Orion closes issues — they are never closed automatically.**

**D55. Configuration or documentation changes — the founder receives them with `git pull`.**

**D56. The founder gives the green light before Orion uses any MCP on application repos.**

**D87. Session close protocol — Orion updates `projects/<project>.md` at the end of every session.**
Shows diff to the founder before push. Source of truth for project state.

---

## 3. GIT AND BRANCHES

**D10. `develop` is the active working branch. `main` is production.**

**D11. `main` is NOT touched — except via planned PR.**

**D12. All team members do `git pull origin develop` before starting work.**

**D14. Orion can push to `develop` for:** config, docs, urgent fixes decided with the founder, Orion OS files.

**D74. Branch protection on `main`.** No direct push. The founder is the sole merger.

---

## 4. PRODUCTION DEPLOYS

**D49. Production deploys via planned PR.**

**D51. Orion NEVER changes `main` outside of a deploy PR.**

---

## 5. SECURITY

**D35. Never commit credentials, tokens, or secrets.**

**D36. Never use `any` in TypeScript without justification.**

**D37. Never break DTO/API contracts the frontend consumes.**

**D73. `ignore-scripts=true` in `.npmrc` in all projects.**

---

## 6. TOOLS AND MCPS

**D38. GitHub MCP connected to Claude for Orion.**

**D68. Agents read issue body only via MCP — corrections go in body, not comments.**
Reason: at the time of writing, the GitHub MCP reads PR comments but not issue
comments reliably. Once GitHub fixes this, the rule becomes: agents read body +
comments, with comments treated as authoritative corrections to the body.
Until then, the founder edits the issue body directly when correcting an agent.

**D82. GitHub MCP tool rules:**

| Tool | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `create_or_update_file` | Files in repo filesystem |
| `update_issue` | Issue body, title, state |
| `create_issue` | New issue |
| `push_files` | Multiple files, single commit |

---

## 7. AGENTS AND MODELS

**D54. Scale model size when:** codebase exceeds context window or smaller model fails twice.

**D63. Lighter models for S/M tasks, larger models for L/XL tasks.**

**D64. The value is in the context, not the model.**

**D66. Model by complexity:**

| Task | Model tier |
|------|-----------|
| Mechanical refactor | Smallest available |
| Bug analysis / features | Mid-tier |
| Architecture | Mid-tier or large |
| Global decisions | Largest available (Orion's tier) |

---

## 8. ORION OS STRUCTURE

**D60. ORION.md lives in the instance repo — not in app repos.**

**D61. CLAUDE.md in each project repo = how to work (≤150 lines).**

**D65. Subagents live in `agents/subagents/` — reusable across projects.**

**D81. Orion asks the founder before any direct code change to application repos.**

---

## 9. ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

**D77.** ① Measure before optimizing. ② Never guess the bottleneck. ③ Avoid unnecessary complexity. ④ Simple fails less. ⑤ Data > algorithm.

---

## 10. DECISION FRAMEWORK

**D78.** Scalable by default. Pragmatic when there is a real deadline. Never silent about the tradeoff.

**D89. Every technical decision must be reversible or explicitly documented as irreversible.**
Reason: Orion OS is evolving toward a web product (v3.0.0). Decisions that block that evolution
must be flagged and justified. When two options exist, always prefer the one that doesn't
close doors for the future interface.

---

## 11. MULTI-PROJECT

**D88. Multi-project rules:**

1. **Each project is fully isolated:** own project.md, own decisions file, own repos, own issues.
2. **D7 applies per project:** max 2 in-progress per project, not global.
3. **Context switch is explicit:** Orion saves state before switching (see `workflows/context-switch.md`).
4. **Decisions go to the right file:** universal → DECISIONS.md (this repo), project-specific → instance `projects/<n>-decisions.md`.
5. **Agents re-bootstrap on project switch:** they must re-read CLAUDE.md from the new repo.
6. **Cross-project decisions are rare:** if one is needed, document in DECISIONS.md and note in both project files.
7. **New projects use the init workflow:** `workflows/project-init.md` + templates. No ad-hoc setup.
8. **Primary project:** the project Orion loads by default at session start. Configurable per instance.

---

## 12. SCAFFOLD AND EXECUTION

**D90. Orion creates project scaffolds via GitHub MCP — never assumes local terminal access.**
Reason: the workflow must scale to the v3.0.0 web interface where no terminal exists.
Orion pushes all source files to the repo. The founder clones and runs `npm install` locally.
This is the only reversible flow — it maps 1:1 to a future "Setup" button in the web UI.

Local AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) can be used by the founder to accelerate
local work, but they are never the required path for a workflow to function. If a
workflow only works with a specific local tool, it is not a valid Orion OS workflow.

---

## 13. DOCUMENTATION

**D91. Instance HOW-TO-USE.md is a living document — updated by Orion at every version bump.**
Triggered by: new Orion OS version, new/removed project, command changes, workflow changes.
Orion owns this file. The founder never edits it manually.
Every update includes a Changelog entry + footer version bump, pushed in the same commit
as the version change.

---

## 14. CODE QUALITY ENFORCEMENT

**D92. Three-layer quality strategy:**

### Layer 1 — Agents (prevention, before commit)
- IDE-level static analysis required in agent bootstrap.
- Inline issue detection while writing code.
- Goal: zero quality-gate issues reach CI.

### Layer 2 — CI (enforcement, on PR)
- Quality scan on every PR to staging and main.
- Quality Gate must pass before merge.
- If Quality Gate fails → fix in `develop`, never skip or bypass.

### Layer 3 — Orion (deploy-only coordination)
- Orion does NOT use quality MCPs during normal development.
- Orion's role is limited to **critical deploy moments**: when Quality Gate
  blocks a release and Orion must triage which issues to fix vs. temporarily
  exclude with justification.
- Orion never excludes files from coverage without creating a follow-up issue with tests.
- Orion never marks a Hotspot as "Safe" without confirming with the founder.

### Issue assignment rule
- Frontend issues → frontend agent
- Backend issues → backend agent
- Orion triages ambiguous cases

---

## 15. SECURITY INCIDENTS

**D93. Security incident response — structured protocol for third-party provider breaches.**
Full protocol: `workflows/security-incident.md`

Key rules:
- Rotate credentials at SOURCE first, then update provider env vars.
- Rotation order: GitHub tokens → OAuth secrets → JWT secrets → DB credentials → email keys → AI API keys.
- Every incident is logged in instance `logs/post-mortems.jsonl`.
- All env vars containing secrets must be marked as `sensitive` in the deploy provider.
- Env vars NOT marked sensitive are treated as potentially exposed in any breach.

## 16. FUTURE

**D40. Orion as multi-project architect.** ✅ Active.

**D43. CI/CD + quality gate is standard for all projects.**
